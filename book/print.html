Corvallis Lodge History
We've been with Corvallis almost from the beginning. Corvallis was incorporated in 1857 in the United States Territory of Oregon. Corvallis had served as the territorial capitol and the county seat before it was even incorporated!</p>
<p>By 1860 the census showed 531 residents, but some say the population at incorporation was closer to three hundred. Fraternal organizations were a major feature of significant communities in the last century. A friendly rivalry ensued between the eighteen charter-member Freemasons and the eighteen charter-member Odd Fellows on which would be the first fraternal Lodge in Corvallis. The two groups pursued their parallel goals in tough times. The early flash of prosperity from mining and military had fizzled out. Early settler Wilson writes in 1854:</p>
<p>Wages are down to almost States prices ... Money is scarce and commands from 20 to 50% ... The mercantile business is overdone ... There is no manufacturing--money is drawn from the country and beef is all they ship out ... The main dependence will be on immigrants&quot;</p>
<p>Depression in this early period continued for several years. By 1859 Wilson writes</p>
<p>It is now almost impossible for the best of men to get hold of a red cent, they can by giving notice to money lenders a week or two in advance and promising to take a certain amount at three per cent a month, get a little.&quot;</p>
<p>For what work could be had, a six-hour workday earned a carpenter five dollars, and for unskilled labor half that. It was in these circumstances that the charter brothers put forward their funds to found Barnum Lodge No. 7.We the undersigned members of the I.O.O.F. subscribe to the sums annexed to our several names for the purpose of defraying expenses connected with the obtaining a Charter for and putting successfully into operation a Subordinate Lodge of I.O.O.F. in the City of Corvallis. It being understood that at such time as the Treasury may be enabled to disburse such amount, that the money be refunded to the donors.</p>

<p>The Masons (AF&amp;AM #14) won the race by thirty-six weeks, being chartered June 12, 1857. Barnum Lodge No. 7 was chartered on February 23, 1858. Corvallis's Odd Fellows Lodge was named for Eli M. Barnum, an energetic officer of the new Grand Lodge of Oregon. Its number seven indicates it was the seventh in Oregon. Six Lodges were in place in other Oregon cities along the settlement trail: Salem, Milwaukie, Oregon City, Albany, The Dalles, and Dallas. Only this last Lodge has succumbed to time (1989).The Odd Fellows and the Masons were the two Lodges capable of building Lodge Halls. The Odd Fellows did not do so, concentrating first on acquiring a cemetery (the I.O.O.F. Pioneer Cemetery of Corvallis) in 1863. The Masons built their first hall, and for a while Barnum Lodge No. 7 rented meeting space there. This first building was destroyed by fire in 1869.</p>
<p>A.W. Bowersox is to date the Barnum Lodge Past Grand that has gone the furthest in service to the Order. Brother Bowersox was elected Grand Master of the Grand Lodge of Oregon at its fifty-seventh session (1912) and Grand Representative (of Oregon to Sovereign Grand lodge} at the 58th session (served 1912-1914). Many souvenirs of his attendance at many Grand Lodge and Sovereign Grand Lodge sessions are treasures of the Lodge. The most significant of these are framed and hang in a place of honor in the Lodge Room.Barnum Lodge Number Seven has been the host Lodge for Grand Lodge sessions five times: in 1863, 1931, 1940, 1958, and 1968.</p>

United Nations Pilgrimage for Youth
We in Odd Fellowship are proud of the opportunity we give students who have completed their sophomore or junior year of high school. Groups of selected students are transported to New York where they have the opportunity to learn about the work the United Nations is doing to promote world peace, to educate the people of the world, and to relieve their suffering whether by famine, disease, or war. Students enjoy a question and answer period that sharpens their comprehension of United Nations affairs. That is but a small part of the learning experience for those selected to participate. The students are taken to many historical places and have a first hand view of their country’s beginning and of the Civil War. They visit many of the cultural and educational centers of the nation. Coming as they do from all areas of the United States and several foreign countries, they exchange views of education, politics, religion, world relationships and cultures. This learning and growing experience provided by Odd Fellows and Rebekahs is one of the most important and effective programs that we have. Approximately 42,000 students have participated in the United Nations Pilgrimage. No other organization is accorded this privilege

<p>Community Service &amp; Living Legacy
Instituted in 1989 with the goal of planting trees to beautify the environment and improve our ecology.  &quot; Plant a tree for those who come after me&quot;.  Many lodges have participated with their city Parks or Recreation Departments of School districts to plant trees in many areas where shade and environmental improvements would be appreciated.  Often Lodges plant trees in honor of members who have passed away.

<p>IOOF SOS Children's Village
Several years ago, recognizing a need to care for orphaned, abandoned, neglected, and abused children, a non-governmental child welfare organization was formed which is now known as the SOS Children’s Villages and provides loving, stable homes in over 132 countries around the world. They serve all children in need regardless of race, nationality or creed. Every child is assured of the love and support of a surrogate parent with brothers and sisters, the opportunity to live in a permanent house, and the positive experience of being part of a larger village community. This prepares them to take their rightful place in society as happy, responsible, and productive adults.
That is precisely what the Independent Order of Odd Fellows did when our children’s homes were operating all over this country for more than a century. At one time the Odd Fellows and Rebekahs had 65 children’s homes in the U.S. and were caring for over 100,000 children. The SOS Village Organization at this time has 456 Villages serving over 58,000 children.</p>
<p>A partnership between the I.O.O.F. and The SOS Children’s Villages will be an ideal relationship between the two most dedicated, private, non-governmental, non-profit organizations in the world who are dedicated to protecting and nurturing orphans and all children in need. There are currently three SOS Villages in the United States and The I.O.O.F. is in the process of building a SOS Village in Cambodia which is planned for dedication in 2006.</p>

<p>Join Barnum Lodge !</p>
<p>In order to join the Lodge you must be sponsored by an Odd Fellow in good standing. Your sponsor will usually be a member of our Lodge but any Odd Fellow can sponsor you.</p>
<p>You must fill out an application form. You can get the application form from you sponsor, at the lodge hall or by filling out the membership application form on this website (below).</p>
<p>When you come to the Lodge you will need to have your application filled out and be prepared to pay the application fee of $40. You will then be interviewed by a committee of members. One question you will be asked is whether you believe in a supreme being, creator and preserver of the universe. If you cannot give an affirmative answer to this question you cannot be admitted as an Odd Fellow.</p>
<p>After you have been interviewed the Lodge will review your application and the report of the interviewing committee. The Lodge then votes to accept you as a member. After the vote, your sponsor will inform you of the outcome of the vote.</p>
<p>If you are accepted as a member of the Lodge you will than have to be initiated. This can happen either at your Lodge or at some other Lodge that is initiating.</p>

If any of these policies are violated the event manager reserves the right to close your event at any time and no refund will be entitled to the customer.</p>
<p>How To Make a Charitable Request To Barnum Lodge</p>
<p>Thank you for choosing the Corvallis Odd Fellows for your charitable request. The mission of the Odd Fellows is to assist those in need in its community.</p>
<p>The Odd Fellows makes grants in two different ways. They can make monetary donations to assist an individual, a non-profit organization or they can grant use of the Odd Fellow facility for community organizations to host special events.</p>
<p>Monetary grants are not for regular, continual funding of an organization. They are one-time donations only and generally do not exceed $1000.00. Use of the Odd Fellow facility may be donated for the use of a non-profit organization and are also on a non-continual basis. Individual assistance is granted to pay a one-time need. These generally do not exceed $500. No one person will receive the grant, it must be paid directly to the agency, utility or other secured business.</p>
<p>Request for monetary grants or facility donations should be sent to the Lodge Secretary in the form of a donation proposal. Monetary grant requests must also be presented by a sponsor or agency, not the individual. Any proposals will be presented at the next regular lodge meeting. Regular Lodge meetings occur on the 1st and 3rd Tuesday’s of each month. Each donation or facility grant must be sponsored by a member of the Lodge and the Lodge body must vote to approve the grant. If a member of the Lodge is willing to sponsor the donation, this member will become the point of contact to the organization. This member will contact the organization and inform them of the approval of the grant. If the grant is a facility donation the sponsoring member is also responsible for the logistics, coordination and representation of the facility and the event.</p>
<p>Due to the meeting schedule of the Lodge the grant process will take a minimum of 45 days. Please be aware that the Grant Committee must make contact with the group or individual making the request and then make a full report to the lodge members. If the members need more information the committee must gather more information and then again report to the members. If you have a deadline that must be met, please take this timeline into consideration. If a grant is not approved the organization will be contacted by the Lodge Secretary.</p>

<p>IOOF Pioneer Cemetery</p>
<p>The Odd Fellows Cemetery Association of Corvallis (OFCA), an Oregon corporation and a 501(c)3 non-profit, operates the historic cemetery atop Cemetery Hill* (4343 Witham Hill Drive) in Corvallis under the supervision of the Oregon Mortuary and Cemetery Board.
*Witham Hill is actually the wooded hill southwest of the Cemetery, but all high ground in the vicinity is popularly called &quot;Witham Hill&quot; now.</p>
<p>Like most non-profit single-purpose corporations, operating this cemetery is its sole &quot;business.&quot; This is carried out as our duty as Odd Fellows to &quot;bury the dead.&quot; The association has a Board of Directors, four in number; who are also the Trustees of Barnum Lodge No. 7, I.O.O.F. The OFCA is thus a &quot;daughter corporation&quot; of the Corvallis Lodge. Its various tax and legal reports are included in the Lodge's filings (e.g. Form 990).</p>
<p>The manager coordinates the various tasks needed to operate the cemetery, including arranging mowing the grounds and maintaining their accessibility to survivors and visitors maintaining the cemetery records and fielding questions concerning them coordinating and supervising burials selling lots.</p>
<p>There are no fixed office hours for the OFCA. The Directors and Manager make time from their other pursuits for these duties as they can. Most operational decisions (paying bills, setting policy) are made at the regular monthly Board meeting.</p>
<p>Other cemetery operational business is done by appointment.</p>
<p>As Odd Fellows have always done as their Duty, YES, we will bury the indigent and the unfortunate. There are no restrictions on who may be buried ; no affiliation with our Order is required. As a matter of heritage, we do encourage local families and members of the Order to consider choosing their internment place atop historic Cemetery Hill.</p>
<p>CONTACT CAN ALWAYS BE MADE BY MESSAGE BY CALLING 1 (541) 752-3023</p>
<p>To see the Corvallis Odd Fellows' Historic Cemetery, go to Find a Grave by clicking on this logo above.  Many thanks to Anonymous for his or her lovely photos. We are fortunate to have such a dedicated  and talented fan of our historic cemetery.</p>
